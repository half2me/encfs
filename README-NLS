EncFS is registered with Rosetta - an online interface for supplying
translations.  See https://translations.launchpad.net/encfs

If your language is not included in this distribution, you may want
to check if translated text is already available online in Rosetta.
If not, consider translating some of the strings, which will then be
included in the next EncFS release.
